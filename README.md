# ***Multi-Port Signal Viewer***


## Introduction

Welcome to the Multi-Port Signal Viewer project! This innovative desktop application reimagines how healthcare professionals monitor vital signals in intensive care units (ICUs). Leveraging the power of **Python** and **Qt**, this innovative tool provides a dynamic platform for visualizing and analyzing critical medical signals like ECG, EMG, EEG, and more.

With features like synchronized dual graphs, real-time cinematic playback, and customizable signal parameters, the ICU Signal Sentinel equips clinicians with enhanced insights, enabling them to make informed decisions and deliver timely interventions for improved patient outcomes. Whether it's tracking normal and abnormal signal patterns or generating detailed reports, the ICU Signal Sentinel is set to become an invaluable asset in modern healthcare settings.

## Features at a Glance

### Signal Selection

- Browse your PC for signal files.
- Explore three distinct medical signals, each with normal and abnormal examples.

### Twin Graphs

- Dual identical graphs with independent controls.
- Synchronize both graphs with a single click.

### Cinematic Experience

- Signals play in real-time, just like ICU monitors.
- Use rewind option to replay signals.
